Creating a Pong game using JavaScript would involve a few steps:

Step 1: Create the HTML canvas element that will serve as the game's display area.
Step 2: Use JavaScript to draw the game elements (e.g., the paddles and the ball) on the canvas.
Step 3: Implement the game logic, including handling user input (e.g., key presses) and updating the positions of the game elements.
Step 4: Use JavaScript to animate the game by repeatedly updating the canvas and re-drawing the game elements.
